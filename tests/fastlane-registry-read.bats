# fastlane resolves a tag to a digest by reading the GHCR packages API through
# the GitHub CLI. Three things have to hold, and none of them did:
#
#   - a gh that fails is a refusal with gh's own reason, not a silent death
#     (the script runs under `set -e`, and a pipeline's status is the
#     pipeline's, so the check that read `$?` could never run);
#   - a gh that succeeds over many pages is a digest, not a refusal (`head -1`
#     closing the pipe mid-fetch made `--paginate` look like a failure, which
#     is likeliest on exactly the busy images --paginate was added for);
#   - a tag goes into the jq program as text, so it has to be a tag.
#
# Each case runs the real script against a fixture repository of its own, with
# a stub gh and --dry-run: no registry is read, no host is touched, and the
# cases do not depend on what this repository's own pins and records say today.
# `fastlane.sh` takes its repository root from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`,
# so running it from inside the fixture is all it takes.
