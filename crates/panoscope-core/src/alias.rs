// Slot alias resolver (ADR 1039 / docs/design/slot-alias-display-layer.md).
//
// Short human aliases (`jane-operator`) are projected over the UUID slot
// anchor (a 32-hex id). The UUID stays the sole
// canonical key in every machine path; this resolver is the boundary that
// translates between the two — `resolve_input` at every input (alias → UUID,
// BEFORE any wire/ACL action) and `render` at every output (UUID → alias,
// AFTER the canonical value is settled). The alias is never produced for a
// wire key, an ACL rule, a cert, or `--json`.
//
// Two invariants make this safe rather than fragile:
//   1. A token is classified alias-vs-UUID by SHAPE alone (a 32-hex string is
//      always the anchor; anything else is an alias candidate). The portal's
//      ValidAlias rejects 32-hex aliases, so the shapes are disjoint.
//   2. An unknown alias FAILS CLOSED (`Err(UnknownAlias)`), never a silent
//      passthrough — a typo can't become a phantom prefix the router silently
//      denies (which would recreate F-177 one layer up).
//
// When the portal can't be reached the registry is simply empty: it resolves
// only UUID-shaped input and renders UUIDs truncated. Aliases never block.
