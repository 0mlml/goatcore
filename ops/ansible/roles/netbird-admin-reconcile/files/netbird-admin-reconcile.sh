# netbird-admin-reconcile.sh — Kratos `groups` -> netbird-mgmt `role`, on a timer.
#
# THE ROLE MAP (docs/design/mesh-change-control.md §2):
#
# NETBIRD_MGMT_ROLE_MAP is an ordered, comma-separated list of GROUP=ROLE pairs,
# ROLE one of user | auditor | admin, e.g.
#   NETBIRD-ADMIN=admin,PLATFORM-ADMIN=auditor,IAM-ADMIN=auditor
# A person's entitled role is the HIGHEST role any of their Ory groups maps to
# (user < auditor < admin). When the map is unset it is derived from the older
# NETBIRD_MGMT_ADMIN_GROUPS (each group -> admin), which is exactly the
# behaviour every goatnet had before the map existed.
#
# WHY A TIMER AND NOT AN ONBOARDING STEP:
#
# NetBird separates two identities: a PEER (an enrolled device) and a USER (a
# dashboard login). Onboarding can mint the peer, but it cannot mint the user —
# we run without NetBird's IdP-manager integration, so `POST /api/users` returns
# 412 "idp manager must be enabled". A user row therefore comes into existence
# ONLY when the person completes their own first OIDC sign-in, and NetBird
# creates it as a plain `user`.
#
# That timing is the whole problem. An onboarding-time promotion has nothing to
# promote, and a reconciler that runs only during dashboard-deploy leaves an
# admin onboarded on Tuesday a non-admin until someone happens to deploy the
# dashboard: correct Ory groups, no NetBird rights, no signal.
#
# So the reconcile must be CONTINUOUS: it watches for the row to appear and
# promotes it within one timer interval, forever, with no operator in the loop.
#
# SAFETY — the two rules this script exists to never break:
#
#   1. It promotes ONLY up the ladder user -> auditor -> admin (from `user` or
#      `auditor`, never from anything else). It never touches `owner`. NetBird has
#      exactly one owner, and the natural-looking predicate `role != 'admin'`
#      MATCHES 'owner' — the previous inline version would have demoted the
#      account owner (who carries PLATFORM-ADMIN like any admin), leaving the
#      goatnet ownerless. Ownership can only be returned by the current owner,
#      so that is a self-inflicted lockout. Promote up from `user`, never sideways
#      from `owner`.
#   2. It is a role-only UPDATE. Never INSERT into netbird `users` — a partial
#      insert leaves NULLs that fail peer-login and drop the mesh.
#
# PROMOTE-ONLY, BY DESIGN — and it REPORTS the other direction. A person whose
# Ory groups stop mapping to admin keeps NetBird `admin` until someone demotes
# them; this timer never does, because an automatic demotion fired by a group
# typo, a map edit or a Kratos outage would strip every admin on the goatnet at
# once. The demotion is an explicit, audited step: `goat admin platform-admin
# revoke` (docs/design/platform-admin-lifecycle.md), or on a goatnet with a role
# map, ops/ansible/netbird-role-realign.yml. What this script does is make the
# gap VISIBLE: every human NetBird admin whose active Kratos identity does not
# map to admin is logged as STRAY and counted in
# netbird_admin_reconcile_stray_admins.
