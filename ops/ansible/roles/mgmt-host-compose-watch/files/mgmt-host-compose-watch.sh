# mgmt-host-compose-watch.sh — F-013 mitigation, roadmap 9L.
#
# Watches the docker-compose stack at /opt/mgmt-host and revives any service
# whose container has exited. Bridges the gap until Docker's native
# restart-policy auto-recovery is reliable on this host's Docker version.
#
# Why a watcher script instead of `docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit`
# under systemd? Targeted recovery: when one service exits unexpectedly, we
# revive only that service rather than tearing down + bringing up the whole
# stack. Lower blast radius; doesn't disturb healthy peers within the stack.
#
# Why not use `docker events`? Watching docker events misses the boot-time
# case where a container was already in 'exited' state when the watcher
# started. The poll-and-revive pattern catches both new exits and stale
# exits without state.
#
# Forward-compatible with the Phase 2D Podman+Quadlet successor track per
# docs/design/container-orchestration.md — Quadlet supervises containers
# natively via systemd. When that migration lands, this watcher retires.
#
# See: docs/findings/F-013-docker-kill-no-auto-restart-on-29.md

# Block 78E: emit Prometheus textfile-collector
# metrics for every compose-defined service so an Exited-and-not-revived
# orphan triggers an alert even when it matches no allowlist entry for revive.
# Metric: compose_service_running{service="...",site="..."} = 0|1.
