"""relay-metrics-ingest — token-gated sink for relay self-published metrics (ADR 1058).

Runs as a small container on the Thor's mgmt network. Each relay POSTs its own
host metrics (the relay-health "deep" shape, read locally — no SSM) to
  POST /relay-metrics-ingest/<relay-name>   Authorization: Bearer <token>
This validates the bearer token + that <relay-name> is a known relay, then
writes <name>.json into INGEST_DIR for the relay-health prober to fold in
(relay-health-probe.sh --ingest-dir). Stdlib only, so it runs under a stock
pinned python image with the script bind-mounted — no custom image to build.

Fail-closed: missing/wrong token -> 401; unknown relay -> 404; oversized or
non-JSON body -> 400. Never trusts the relay's clock — stamps server received_at.

Env:
  RELAY_METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN   shared bearer token (required; refuses to start if unset)
  RELAY_METRICS_ALLOWED_NAMES  comma-separated known relay names (required)
  RELAY_METRICS_INGEST_DIR     output dir (default /ingest)
