"""relay-peer-names — resolve relay per-peer hashed IDs to friendly NetBird names (ADR 1055).

The relay per-peer stats key each peer by the relay PeerID, which the stats endpoint
renders as hex:  hex("sha-") + sha256(wg_pubkey)  (verified end-to-end: the relay
client hashes myPrivateKey.PublicKey().String() via messages.HashID, and HashID is
[]byte("sha-") ++ sha256(peerID)). That hash is one-way, so a dashboard can only show
the hex unless something holds the pubkey->name preimage. The NetBird management store
(Postgres) does — and only the Thor can reach it.

This runs on the Thor, reads (key,name) for every peer, computes the exact hex the relay
emits, and publishes a {hex: name} map to the relay-health ingest(s) so BOTH the Thor
mesh dashboard and the cloud dashboard render names with the hex revealed on hover:
  - writes peer-names.json into the local ingest dir (the Thor's own www/ingest), and
  - POSTs the map to any remote ingest URLs (the cloud box), reusing the ADR 1058
    bearer-gated channel (POST <base>/peer-names).

The map is only pubkey-derived hashes + display names — never a pubkey, never a cert.
The served file sits behind the same ADMINS oauth2-proxy gate as the dashboard.

Env:
  RELAY_PEER_NAMES_PG_CONTAINER   mgmt postgres container (default postgres-a)
  RELAY_PEER_NAMES_PG_DB          database (default netbird)
  RELAY_PEER_NAMES_PG_USER        db user (default postgres)
  RELAY_PEER_NAMES_LOCAL_DIR      local ingest dir to write peer-names.json into (optional)
  RELAY_PEER_NAMES_INGEST_URLS    comma-sep remote ingest base URLs (…/relay-metrics-ingest) (optional)
  RELAY_METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN      bearer for the remote POST (required when URLS set)
