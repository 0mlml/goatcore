# Peer → responsible person, resolved against the portal's access graph.
#
# THE PYTHON CLIENT for `POST /api/access/peers`
# (docs/design/peer-identity-resolution.md, Option B). It is the third of three
# and deliberately the last one written by hand:
#
#   Go     the Thor resolver baking the relay-health card's "identity & access →"
#          link (ops/relay/health/relay-peer-names.py drives it; the card is Go)
#   Rust   panoscope_core::peerowner — netvis + panoscope
#   Python this module — the peerview surfaces and the Thor peer-name resolver
#
# WHY A SHARED MODULE AND NOT ANOTHER INLINE POST. The endpoint is shared; the
# READING of it was not. Its wire format distinguishes "handle matched but no
# live identity" from "the name carries no principal" only in prose — both are
# `resolved: false`, separated by whether `handle` is present — and it has no
# way at all to say "we could not ask", because a transport failure is the
# caller's to name. So every consumer that reads this API raw has to rediscover
# the same four states, and the ones that do not rediscover them render a blank
# that a reader takes for "unowned". Rust typed it; Go and Python each had their
# own partial version inline. This is that type, once, for Python.
#
# THE HONESTY RULE, carried verbatim from panoscope_core::peerowner and
# ultimately from the peer-name grammar SoT: *a peer name is EVIDENCE about
# ownership, never a record of it — the recorded linkage is `slots.identity_id`,
# stamped at onboard. A consumer that presents ownership must say which of the
# two it used.* Which is why this returns an attribution with every row and a
# caller can never receive a bare name to render as fact.
#
# NO PII LEAVES THIS MODULE BY DEFAULT. The endpoint is operator-scoped and
# returns the person's email and display name. `resolve()` keeps the Ory
# identity id (the deep-link key) and drops the rest unless asked, so a surface
# that renders handles cannot leak a roster of email addresses into a served
# json by forgetting to strip a field.

import json
import subprocess
import urllib.error
import urllib.request

# The four states. Never collapse them — each renders differently.
#
#   REGISTRY   the handle matched a roster member AND a live Ory identity shares
#              the roster's email-hash. The recorded linkage. Safe to present as
#              "who owns this"; carries the id-console deep-link.
#   NAME       the handle parsed and matched a roster member, but no live
#              identity did. Org known, person not. A lead, never an answer.
#   CUSTODY    the peer is a machine the portal enrolled (`machine-<handle>`);
#              `handle` is its CUSTODIAN, the person who enrolled it, and
#              `custody_of` is the machine. A machine cannot answer for itself.
#              `ory_id` is present only when the custodian is a live identity.
#   UNMATCHED  no declared identity matched. The resolver's `reason` says why,
#              and it is not always "no principal": a name can follow the
#              onboarding grammar and still miss a roster that has not caught
#              up with a runner mint. NOT "nobody is responsible".
#   UNREAD     we could not ask. Portal unreachable, unauthorized, or unset.
#              Distinct from UNMATCHED on purpose: "we did not look" and "we
#              looked and found no principal" are different facts.
