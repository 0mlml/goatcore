//! E1 — the key-distribution service core (design §3, M2.1).
//!
//! The state machine and assembly pipeline, off the read path: on a grant change
//! or rotation trigger it resolves the audience, mints a fresh DEK for the next
//! generation, wraps it to each member, signs the bundle, and publishes it on
//! `keys/<release-set>/<generation>`. The two integration seams — resolving the
//! audience and publishing to the fabric — are traits, so this logic is testable
//! in isolation; the live Zenoh publisher and HTTP resolver are concrete impls
//! added on top.
//!
//! Rotation model (per the external review's readmission point): each rotation is
//! a new generation. A revoked member is simply absent from the next generation's
//! bundle; a re-admitted member reappears in a later generation and never receives
//! the generations it was excluded from — the generation label carries revocation.
