//! The rotation sweep — the daemon's poll-driven decision to rotate, or not.
//!
//! `KeyService::rotate` always mints a *new* generation. A poll loop must not spam
//! generations every tick, so the daemon rotates a release-set only when its
//! resolved audience has **changed** since the last generation it published (or on
//! first sight). This is the honest poll-based realization of the design's
//! "rotate on access-rule change" trigger: no change-feed yet, so we diff.
//!
//! The audience fingerprint covers each member's id and public key, order-
//! independent — so a reorder does not trigger a needless rotation, but an add,
//! remove, or key change does.
