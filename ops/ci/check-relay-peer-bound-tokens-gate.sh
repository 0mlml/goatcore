# Fuse: refuse to enable ADR 1021 Phase C (peer-bound-only relay tokens) while
# the peer-binding patch's REFRESH paths are still broken.
#
# Why this exists: peer binding is correct on the login / initial-sync
# path, and broken on every refresh path. Management re-mints relay tokens at
# 3/4 of CredentialsTTL. If Phase C is enabled, every peer in the fleet is locked
# out of the relay that long after it last logged in, and the relay client retries
# the refused token forever with no re-login edge — a fleet-wide, self-sustaining
# outage that looks like a tunnel wedge but is not.
#
# Three independent breakages, all in ops/netbird/patches/peer-id-bound-relay-tokens.patch:
#
#   1. SetupRefresh() is called with peer.ID (the DB primary key) and the patch
#      feeds that same variable to GenerateRelayToken() as if it were peer.Key
#      (the WireGuard public key). Management then signs HashID(peer.ID)||payload
#      while the client presents HashID(peer.Key) — wrong MAC preimage, so the
#      relay rejects with "invalid signature" for every peer, permanently.
#   2. The client's Engine.handleRelayUpdate() drops AuthAlgo, so a refreshed
#      algo-2 token is stamped algo-1 and validated against the wrong preimage
#      shape — breaks refresh independently of (1).
#   3. pushNewRelayTokens() (the relay-only refresh ticker) was never patched at
#      all: it still mints unbound tokens and omits TokenAuthAlgo.
#
# The patch's own lockout-guard test does not catch any of these because it calls
# the generator directly instead of driving the push/refresh callers.
#
# Lift this fuse only when all three are fixed AND a test drives the refresh
# path end-to-end (mint at refresh -> present as the client would -> validate
# with the relay's validator).
