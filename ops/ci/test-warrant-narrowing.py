Tests for the narrowing prover — ADR 1129 C4.

This one decides whether a change to the mesh ACL can merge without a human,
so the tests that matter most are the ones proving it REFUSES: an auto-approve
that is wrong in the permissive direction merges an over-grant unattended.

Every case is built from the real matrix so the shapes are the shapes that
actually occur.
