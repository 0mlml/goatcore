# ops/ci/check-kratos-config-renders.sh
#
# Renders ops/ansible/roles/ory/templates/ory/kratos.yaml.j2 for every goatnet
# and asserts Kratos ACCEPTS the result.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A role knob can render a key Kratos has never had (for example
# `selfservice.flows.login.required_aal`). An invalid key is not a soft failure:
# Kratos refuses to boot on it, so enabling the knob takes a goatnet's whole
# identity plane down at the next `ory` role run.
#
# The role fixture (roles/ory/tests/test-fixture.sh) cannot catch this: that
# fixture writes its OWN hand-authored kratos.yaml heredoc and never renders the
# template.
#
# HOW IT VALIDATES. There is no `kratos validate --config`; `kratos validate`
# handles resources (identities, schemas), not the config file. But Kratos
# validates its config against the embedded JSON schema BEFORE it touches the
# database, so `kratos serve -c <file>` reaches a decisive verdict in about a
# second: a schema violation prints "The configuration contains values or keys
# which are invalid" and exits, while a valid config gets as far as a DSN or
# migration complaint. We assert on the schema verdict only — a DSN error means
# the config PASSED.
#
# Usage:
#   ops/ci/check-kratos-config-renders.sh            # all goatnets
#   ops/ci/check-kratos-config-renders.sh <site>_hosts # one
#
# Requires: docker, python3 with jinja2 + pyyaml.
