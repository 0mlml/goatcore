warrant registry gate — ADR 1129. Five checks, all fail-closed.

The registry (ops/warrant/port-sets.yaml + ops/warrant/rule-intents/) is the
source of ops/ansible/netbird_acl_matrix.yml. This guard is what makes that
sentence true rather than aspirational.

WHY THE BYTE-IDENTICAL CHECK IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. The cutover from a
hand-written ACL to a generated one is only safe if the generator provably
changes nothing. Not "equivalent" — identical. An equivalence argument is a
judgement call made once by whoever wrote the generator; byte-identity is a
fact re-established on every push. It is also what lets steps 1-3 of the plan
run against a live fleet: if the bytes do not move, no goatnet moves.

WHY AN ADVISORY REGISTRY WOULD BE WORSE THAN NONE. F-324 — three files
described a topology no host carried. A registry that describes what the rules
should contain, without generating them, is that finding by construction: it
accumulates authority in operators' heads while drifting from the deployed
state, and the drift is silent because nothing compares them. It generates, or
it is not worth building.

Checks:

  1. BYTE-IDENTICAL — the generated matrix equals the committed one, exactly.
  2. FAITHFUL EXTRACTION — re-deriving the intents from the matrix is a no-op,
     so the registry is a mechanical transform of the declaration rather than a
     hand transcription a reviewer would have to trust.
  3. VOCABULARY INTEGRITY — every set has a purpose and an owner, no set
     declares two arms for one protocol, and no (protocol, ports) shape is
     claimed by two names. Two names for one shape IS the re-fragmentation this
     registry exists to prevent.
  4. required_by COVERAGE — every pair a set declares it is required by is
     actually granted that set somewhere. This is what makes a narrowing fail
     loudly instead of quietly severing a class.
  5. EXPIRY — a rule intent carrying `expires:` must carry an `owner:`, must
     parse as a date, and must not be past due.

Scope limit, stated rather than implied: this is FILE-level. Every check here
can pass while a goatnet runs flat on NetBird's Default All->All, because
nothing here reads a live mesh. Live posture is the cutover play's mode=propose
report. Same boundary as check-netbird-acl-parity.py; see F-283.
