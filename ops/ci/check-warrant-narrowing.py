Is this ACL change a NARROWING? — ADR 1129 C4.

A narrowing grants nothing that was not already granted. It can merge without
waiting for its owner, because the only thing it can do is take access away —
and taking access away is recoverable by `git revert`, while granting it is
not recoverable by anything.

A widening waits for the owner named in CODEOWNERS. That asymmetry is the
whole reason the design is fast, and it is one CI check rather than a queue, a
state machine or an approval service.

THE PROOF, AND ITS DIRECTION OF ERROR. For every permit in the proposed ACL,
there must be a permit in the base ACL that already covered it. If one does
not exist, the change grants something new and is NOT a narrowing. The check
is conservative: a genuine narrowing expressed in a way it cannot follow
grades as "not proven", which sends it to a human. Being wrong in that
direction costs a review; being wrong in the other direction auto-merges an
over-grant.

`protocol: all` covers tcp/udp/icmp and an EMPTY ports list means EVERY port —
that is NetBird's own reading, and inverting either would silently treat a
wide rule as narrow, which is the direction a security surface must never be
wrong in.

Usage:
    check-warrant-narrowing.py BASE_MATRIX HEAD_MATRIX
    check-warrant-narrowing.py --json BASE HEAD
    check-warrant-narrowing.py --membership BASE_DIR HEAD_DIR

MEMBERSHIP (docs/design/mesh-change-control.md §4.3). With `--membership` the
two paths are one scope's directory, ops/warrant/membership/<scope>/, at base
and head (BASE may also be the retired single file <scope>.yaml, so the change
that converts a scope still grades). The prover compares the MERGED views —
every fragment's entries by peer, plus _scope.yaml and the generated baseline —
so an entry moved between fragments unchanged is no change at all. A missing
or empty BASE is a scope with no entries yet; a missing HEAD is the scope
being deleted, which ungoverns it and is never a narrowing. The diff is a
narrowing when every changed entry only:

  - removes `grant` groups, or adds `absent` groups;
  - adds a `hold` (or replaces an entry with one);
  - shrinks an `exact`;
  - is a NEW `exact` naming only hold lanes (`<P>-PROBATION-*`,
    `<P>-QUARANTINED`) — what the lifecycle sweep writes, and the least reach
    a peer can hold short of none;
  - is deleted, when it only granted.

Editing `owner` or `reason` changes no access. An earlier `expires`, or one
added, is a narrowing; a later or removed one extends a grant and is not.
Changing `scope` or `converge` is never proven: `report -> enforce` is what
makes every entry real.

THE DECLARED BASELINE (_baseline.generated.yaml) is graded too, because it is
every person-device's starting set: a person's `device`/`handset` list losing
groups narrows; gaining one, a person added, a person removed (their peers
fall back to the minting key's auto_groups) or the baseline appearing for the
first time is never proven.

Exit: 0 = proven narrowing (or no change), 1 = widens / not proven, 2 = error.

In CI the base file comes from `git show <base-sha>:ops/ansible/...`.
