# check-no-live-secret.sh — refuse to commit a value that is a CURRENTLY-LIVE
# secret, by hash-comparing content against the operator's own environment.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is separate from every other guard here.
# GitHub push protection and secret scanning (enabled) catch secrets
# with a KNOWN SHAPE — AWS keys, GitHub tokens, provider patterns. They cannot
# catch NB_ENCKEY, BKP_KEY, a Postgres password or a portal operator key,
# because those are bare high-entropy strings with no distinguishing pattern.
# check-no-identity-spillage.sh catches age recipients and SSH pubkeys by shape.
# Nothing catches "this base64 blob is, byte for byte, the encryption key a live
# goatnet is using right now."
#
# the pre-open-sourcing history triage found exactly that: an e2e
# fixture (netbird-dashboard/tests/fixture-e2e/seed.sh) carried a
# DataStoreEncryptionKey identical to the live NB_ENCKEY of four goatnets, and a
# deleted tee-up doc carried the live portal operator key. Neither has a
# recognisable shape; both would have sailed through every shape-based guard.
# NB_ENCKEY in particular has no rotation path, so its leak is
# permanent — which is why the operator's instruction was specifically that a
# real environment's NB_ENCKEY must never be committed.
#
# THE ONE PLACE THIS CAN RUN is where the live values are: the operator laptop,
# via direnv. CI cannot run it — the CI runner has no .envrc.local.d and must
# not. So this is a PRE-COMMIT / operator-laptop control by construction, and it
# says so loudly when the environment is absent rather than pretending to pass.
#
# It compares by SHA-256. No secret value is ever read into a variable that is
# printed, logged, or placed on a command line; only digests are compared, and
# only the VARIABLE NAME of a match is ever emitted.
#
# Usage:
#   ops/ci/check-no-live-secret.sh --staged     # pre-commit: scan the staged diff
#   ops/ci/check-no-live-secret.sh <path>...    # scan named files
#   ops/ci/check-no-live-secret.sh              # scan the whole tracked tree
#
# Exit: 0 clean (or environment absent — see below) · 1 a live secret is present
#       · 2 usage error.

MIN_LEN=16   # shorter env values are not credentials; comparing them invites
             # false positives on common words that happen to match a short var.

# --- is this value credential-SHAPED, or is it a name? -----------------------
# Length alone does not separate them. `$ZAGROS_AUDIT_SUBSCRIBER_S3_ACCESS_KEY`
# holds a 16-character hyphenated lowercase SERVICE NAME — the same word that
# names the container, the scrape job, the rule file and the finding — so it
# clears MIN_LEN and appears legitimately in prose all over the repo. On
# it refused an unrelated edit to a group_vars comment listing
# scrape ports, and refused every edit to docs/findings/INDEX.md, in two
# different sessions on the same day. A guard that cannot be satisfied is a
# guard people learn to pass with --no-verify, which is worse than not having
# one. Diff-scoping would not have helped: in both cases the word was on a line
# the author genuinely added.
#
# THE TEST, and why it cannot skip a real secret. A value is treated as a NAME
# rather than a credential when all three hold:
#
#   * it is entirely lowercase [a-z0-9_-], and
#   * it contains at least one `-` or `_` separator, and
#   * some separated segment contains a letter outside [a-f].
#
# Each clause is load-bearing. All-lowercase keeps base64 (mixed case) and
# AGE-SECRET-KEY-… (uppercase) protected. Requiring a separator keeps bare hex
# and base64 digests, which have none. Requiring a non-hex letter keeps UUIDs
# and hyphen-grouped hex, whose segments are hex-only. What is left — a
# lowercase word with hyphens containing letters like r, s or t — is not the
# output of any generator this repo uses, and grep could never have protected
# it anyway, because it is *supposed* to appear in prose.
#
# Skipped values are counted and named at the end, never silently dropped. A
# credential whose value is a guessable service name is weak independent of
# this scanner, and the operator should be told which ones are in that state.
# MAX_NAME_SEGMENT bounds how long one piece of a "name" may be. Words are
# short. This clause is what stops the filter unprotecting a strong secret that
# merely happens to be lowercase: `SNITCH_ADMIN_KEY` is a short prefix, an
# underscore, and a 64-character random lowercase segment — all-lowercase, with
# a separator, with non-hex letters, and therefore a NAME by the first three
# clauses alone. It is not a name; it is roughly 330 bits of entropy. The three
# SNITCH_* keys and both PROVENANCE_GUARD_PORTAL_KEYs were briefly unprotected
# for exactly that reason. Twenty-four is well above any real segment
# (`auditreader` is 11, `subscriber` is 10) and far below a generated one.
