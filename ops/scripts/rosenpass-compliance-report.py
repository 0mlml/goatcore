"""How much of the mesh negotiates post-quantum key exchange.

READ-ONLY. Changes nothing, ever. Safe on a timer.

WHAT THIS MEASURES AND WHY IT IS PERMANENT. Rosenpass is a per-peer client
setting that survives upgrades and re-enrolment, so the share of the fleet
carrying it is a standing property of the goatnet, not a fact about any one
remediation. It will matter again the next time the setting is turned on
deliberately (the eventual PQC rollout), turned on by accident (a stale doc, a
copied command), or needs to be proven off for an audit.

Deliberately NOT modelled here: campaigns. An earlier version of this file
hardcoded a mailing cohort, a peer count "at the notice" and a deadline, and
exported `goat_rosenpass_peers_cleared_since_notice`. Every one of those is a
timestamp pretending to be a fact — correct for about a day, then quietly wrong
forever, on a dashboard nobody would think to re-read. Trend belongs in the
time-series database, which already stores it: `delta(goat_rosenpass_peers_enabled[24h])`
answers "how is this moving" for any window, at any time, without this script
remembering anything.

WHY PEER COUNT AND NOT BYTES. Attribution by traffic is not available: the
signal server exposes no byte-size metric, and the message body is an opaque
NaCl box, so no label distinguishing post-quantum traffic can exist. Peer count
is the one Rosenpass fact that is counted rather than inferred, which is why it
is the one published continuously.
