# generate-pins.py — the CLI over ONE resolution pass with TWO renderings:
#
#   1. `ops/ansible/group_vars/<member>/pins.yml` for every member host-group of
#      every goatnet listed in ops/pins/fleet-pins.yaml (plus the lite sidecar
#      ops/pins/lite-pins.yaml, ADR 1213), so "what image does this goatnet
#      run" has ONE source of truth.
#   2. `ops/consistency/intent/<goatnet>/intent.json` — IntentV1, the typed
#      intent artifact every downstream consumer reads INSTEAD of re-resolving
#      the tree (docs/design/consistency-foundation.md §3, ADR 1110 D1).
#
# Two renderings from one resolver is the pattern ops/dns/generate-mesh-hosts.py
# already established when it emitted both the zone file and the name snapshot.
#
# THIS FILE IS A CLI, NOT A LIBRARY. Since CF-2 the resolution semantics live in
# ops/consistency/python/goat_consistency/ and are imported; what remains here
# is argument parsing, the pins.yml text rendering, the shrink-only ratchet on
# the unmigrated tail, and the exit codes. Anything that decides what a value IS
# belongs in the package, where a second implementation can be held to the same
# golden corpus.
#
# Canon: docs/design/environment-parity.md §3 + docs/design/consistency-
# foundation.md §3/§4. Modelled on ops/dns/generate-mesh-hosts.py — the F-197
# arc, where a hand-synced pair of files was first linted and then replaced by
# generation, and nothing in that class has recurred since.
#
# SCOPE IS FORWARD-ONLY. Only goatnets listed in fleet-pins.yaml are governed.
# Legacy envs are not listed, so nothing here can fail on their account.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)   rewrite every listed member's pins.yml from the table, and
#               every listed goatnet's intent.json
#   --check     validate the table, regenerate, and fail (exit 1) on any
#               difference; fail on a committed intent.json whose detached
#               offline-CA signature is missing or does not verify (CF-5,
#               design doc §3.4 — sign with ops/enrollment/cmd/intent-sign);
#               ALSO fail on a governed pin var defined outside
#               pins.yml anywhere in a listed goatnet's group_vars (the
#               shadowing hazard: within one group_vars dir the
#               later-loading file wins, and `vars.yml` sorts after
#               `pins.yml`, so a leftover hand pin silently shadows the
#               generated one). The unmigrated tail lives in
#               ops/pins/unmigrated-pins.txt and may only SHRINK.
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 drift/violation, 2 usage or schema error.

# To bump an image: edit fleet-pins.yaml, rerun the generator, commit both. The

# PRECEDENCE HAZARD (the reason a hand pin must not come back): within one
# group_vars directory ansible loads files alphabetically and the later file
# WINS on a key conflict. `vars.yml` sorts after `pins.yml`, so a pin re-added
# to vars.yml would silently shadow this file. That is what the CI job's
