# report.py — the parity report, STAGE 1 (intent parity, repo-side only).
#
# Renders "what is each governed goatnet SUPPOSED to run", as a component x node
# matrix from ops/pins/fleet-pins.yaml plus a curated set of capability flags
# from ops/pins/parity-capabilities.yaml — the question that otherwise takes
# archaeology across ~16 var files.
#
# Canon: docs/design/environment-parity.md §5 (stage 1). The design doc names
# the operator-facing path `ops/scripts/parity-report.sh`; that exists and is a
# thin wrapper on this file, so the pin machinery stays in one directory.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. This report reads the COMMITTED TREE. It does not contact
# any host, so it cannot tell you what is running anywhere. Stage 2 (design doc
# §5, queued) joins the on-host /var/lib/goat/<component>/deploy-history.jsonl
# tips and adds the intra-goatnet node-skew view; until then "the repo says X"
# is the only claim this file is entitled to make, and it says so on every
# render.
#
# HONESTY RULES (design doc §2 principle 4, binding):
#   - A value the report cannot resolve renders `unreadable`, never OK. A row
#     with any unreadable cell grades `unreadable`, never `match`.
#   - A key with no answer anywhere renders `unset` — distinct from unreadable
#     (nothing to read vs. read it and could not evaluate it).
#   - Nothing is silently omitted: pins outside the fleet table render as
#     UNGOVERNED rows, retired keys render as absence assertions, and the
#     goatnets this report does not govern are named rather than dropped.
#   - No percentages. A ratio over a set this small invents precision.
#
# DOWNGRADED BY CF-3 (consistency-foundation.md §5.4). This file used to WRITE a
# committed render, `ops/pins/parity-report.md`, gated by the fleet-pins CI job.
# That file is deleted and that gate now sits on `ops/consistency/intent/<g>/
# intent.json`, which is what it was always really gating: a resolved,
# per-member, schema-validated answer to "what is this goatnet supposed to run",
# readable by consumers that hold no checkout.
#
# What survives is the RENDER, on demand, to stdout — because a human-legible
# matrix of the same facts is still the fastest way to answer the question in a
# terminal, and it costs nothing to keep once it owns no file and no gate. What
# does NOT survive is any committed output: a second committed rendering of the
# artifact would be exactly the "one fact, two homes" drift this arc exists to
# remove, and the one that goes stale is always the prose one.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)   render to stdout, write nothing
#   --stdout    the same thing, named, for scripts that want to be explicit
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 usage or schema error.
