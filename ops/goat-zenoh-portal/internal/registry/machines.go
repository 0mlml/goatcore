// ADR 1096 — delegated machine enrollment (docs/design/machine-enrollment.md).
//
// Stage 1: the quota + custody-edge model. A custodian person carries an
// enrollment_grant (a quota — onboard-tier-role-model.md §5); each machine they
// enroll takes its own slot (ADR 1025) and gets stamped with the person→system
// custody edge plus the grammar born-as snapshot (node-class / autonomy /
// inherited affiliation — ADR 1043 / identity-grammar.md §1.4, §2).
//
// Remaining quota is DERIVED, never stored: quota − COUNT(live enrolled slots).
// So revoking a machine (slots.revoked_at set) returns its quota by construction.
