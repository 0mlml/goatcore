// Machine revoke — the inverse of the mint (machine-mesh-alignment follow-on;
// the M-107 §5 remainder).
//
// A machine has four doors in (enroll, enroll-bulk, mesh-key, GET) and needs an
// exit: without one, a machine brought into existence — own slot, own cert,
// custody edge, one-off setup key — could never be retired.
//
// DELETE /api/machines/{anchor} is that exit. Three properties are deliberate:
//
//   - MESH-FIRST (ADR 1031). The authoritative cut lives at NetBird, not at
//     the Zenoh ACL: in per-uuid slot-pool mode the router bakes a
//     `slot-w-<anchor>` grant for EVERY slot unconditionally, so the registry
//     teardown moves no authorization at all and mesh removal is the only
//     barrier that actually falls. The mesh cut therefore runs FIRST and a
//     failure there aborts with the registry untouched — a half-cut that
//     reported success would leave a live peer behind a row that says retired,
//     which is worse than a clean refusal to retry.
//   - THE UNCONSUMED KEY GOES TOO. A machine's setup key is one-off with a
// 30-day join window (D4). An unspent one left standing for a retired machine
// is a standing invitation carrying gear groups that nobody re-reads.
//   - QUOTA RETURNS BY CONSTRUCTION. Remaining quota is derived
//     (quota − COUNT(live enrolled slots)), never stored, so stamping
//     revoked_at IS the refund. Nothing here adds to a counter.
//
// Not reversible in the restore sense, and the response says so: re-enrolling
// the handle allocates a FRESH slot with a new anchor. What survives is the
// record — the slot row keeps its born-as stamps and custody edge alongside
// revoked_at, and the audit event carries the full inventory of what was cut.
