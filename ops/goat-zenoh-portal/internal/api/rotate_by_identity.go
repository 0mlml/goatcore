// in-place re-issue. Same trust boundary as collection (collect.go): the
// caller — goat-id-console, holding the shared operator bearer and naming the
// admin via X-Goat-Operator-Actor — says WHO the person is, never
// which anchor. The portal resolves identity → slot itself, so a caller
// cannot rotate someone else's anchor by asking; it never gets to name one.
//
// The rotation performed is rotateAnchor, the exact machinery behind the
// CLI's POST /api/orgs/{anchor}/rotate — one implementation, two doors.

// rotateByIdentityRequest names the person whose credential rotates, and
// nothing else. Deliberately no anchor/prefix/alias field — see above.
