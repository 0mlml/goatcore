// Mint-on-collect: a person's fabric credential is minted when they come and
// collect it, not when an operator onboards them.
//
// The finding that forces this shape: a portal API key CANNOT be shown after it
// is minted. The registry keeps a bcrypt hash and the plaintext is returned
// exactly once (see rotateVendor, which says outright that the old plaintext is
// unrecoverable). So a credential minted at onboard can only be delivered by
// carrying it out to the person in an email, or by persisting the plaintext so
// it can be re-read later. The second puts a live bearer token at rest for no
// functional gain. The third option is this one: don't mint until they ask.
//
// SCOPE — PEOPLE ONLY. A machine cannot complete an Ory login, so it can never
// collect. Machine enrollment keeps minting at enrollment and delivering to a
// human custodian (ADR 1096). Nothing here may be reached from that path.
//
// TRUST BOUNDARY. The collector authenticates to goat-id-console (Ory, through
// oauth2-proxy); the console calls this with its operator bearer and names the
// authenticated person by Kratos identity UUID. Holding an operator key IS the
// trust boundary (the same delegation X-Goat-Operator-Actor already relies on,
// F-207). The portal then resolves identity → slot ITSELF: the caller says who
// the person is, never which anchor to mint. A caller cannot ask for someone
// else's slot because it never gets to name a slot at all.

// collectRequest names the person collecting, and nothing else. There is
// deliberately no anchor/prefix/alias field — see the trust boundary above.

	APIKey       string `json:"api_key"`       // one-time; bcrypt hash kept, plaintext unrecoverable
	BundleURL    string `json:"bundle_url"`    // one-time tarball download URL

// documents why: the old plaintext is unrecoverable, so one cannot be re-issued
// without the other), and for a FIRST collection that coupling is ideal: nobody
// is using the cert yet, so the identity is created when its owner asks for it.
//
// Collection is the same mint onboarding does today, moved later and
// authenticated differently. No new decoupled portal operation is required.
