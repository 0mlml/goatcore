// Package safego provides panic-safe goroutine spawning for load-bearing
// services in ops/time-hygiene.
//
// Block 50B.2 — Panic-recovery middleware.
//
// Rationale: a panic in any unrecovered goroutine kills the entire process,
// taking down the admit sidecar (and therefore peer enrollment) or the health
// agent (and therefore every admit-class call across the site). For services
// that already swallow per-iteration faults at the protocol level (chrony
// poll error → mark unknown, accept loop dial error → log + continue), an
// unrecovered panic is a strictly worse failure mode than a logged-and-
// continued panic.
//
// Spawn wraps `go func(){ ... }()` with `defer recover()`. On panic it logs a
// structured slog event with the panic value + full stack trace + the caller-
// supplied name, then increments the Prometheus counter
// `time_hygiene_panic_total{service=<service>,goroutine=<name>}` so an
// operator can alert on panic rate. The wrapped function does NOT re-panic;
// the goroutine returns normally and the surrounding loop / caller is
// expected to either re-spawn (poll loops) or accept the loss (per-request
// goroutines). For long-running drivers the caller can layer its own restart
// policy on top of safego.
//
// SetService MUST be called once at process start so the counter carries the
// right service label. If unset, the counter is labeled service="unknown",
// which still alerts but yields a less actionable signal.

//
// name should be a stable, low-cardinality descriptor of the goroutine's

//
//	go func() {
//	    defer wg.Done()
//	    defer safego.Recover("my-goroutine")
//	    // body

// Note: when chaining defers, place safego.Recover INNERMOST (closest to the
// body) so any other defers (Done, Close) still fire after recovery.
