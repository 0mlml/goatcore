// RegisterMintedProposal records an onboarding that happened through the CLI
// mint path (`goat admin onboard`) rather than the console's review queue.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. There are two ways somebody gets onboarded and both must
// record the same things: the console path writes the operator manifest and a
// proposal row, so the CLI path writes both too. Every lifecycle lane — the
// ADR 1136 dormancy sweep, the `archived` cold-storage pass,
// `ops/identity/identity-usage.py` — enumerates THIS store, so anyone onboarded
// by CLI without a row here would be invisible to all of them.
//
// THE ROW LANDS AT `onboarded`, NOT `proposed`. The gates exist to decide
// whether to mint; this is called AFTER a mint that already happened, performed
// by an operator who holds mint authority. Writing it as `proposed` would
// invent a decision nobody is waiting to make and would put a live credential
// in a review queue. `Retroactive` is deliberately NOT set — that flag means
// "provenance predates the three-stage system", and this row has provenance:
// the operator who ran the mint.
//
// IDEMPOTENT BY EMAIL. Re-running a mint, or re-running the backfill, must not
// produce a second row for one person — that is exactly the collision the
// email-keyed pre-mint check exists to prevent (ADR 1048). An existing
// non-terminal row wins and is returned unchanged; the caller is told it
// already existed rather than being handed a silent no-op.
