// Operator-key browser realm — the human half of "self-service request,
// admin-gated approval" (docs/design/operator-action-audit.md).
//
//	GET/POST /operator-key             — any signed-in person, their OWN key
//	GET      /operator-key/collect/{id} — the single delivery of the secret
//	GET      /onboarding/operator-keys — ADMINS ONLY, the approval queue
//	POST     /operator-keys/{id}/{action}
//
// The split is the same one SSH keys use, for the same reason: the console is
// reachable with an ordinary web session, so requesting must never authorize.
// What differs is the tail. An SSH key still needs an installer run against
// hosts, so approved is genuinely not access. An operator key is live as soon
// as the file lands and the portal reloads, so approval IS the grant — and the
// wording must not borrow the SSH page's "not yet" or people will sit waiting
// for a step that does not exist.
//
// Because approval IS the grant, two rules bind the queue (#210): it sits
// behind adminGate (not the sponsor-admitting onboardGate the rest of
// /onboarding takes), and the store refuses any approve/reject whose decider
// is the row's own requester — two humans per credential, on both doors.

// operatorKeyEligible reports whether this person may hold an operator key at
// all.
//
// An operator key is not a bigger version of the vp_ key every onboarded person
// already has: it authorizes the Portal's whole admin API AND this console's
// machine API for every org, slot and person on the goatnet. So the people who
// may hold one are exactly the people who may already act as admins here, and
// the predicate is the matrix (ADR 1073) rather than a group literal — the same
// question adminGate asks, asked about the requester.
//
// /operator-key shows a request form only to these people. Checking only the
// decider is not enough: an admin could otherwise approve a developer's request
// whose reason describes the vp_ key's job, such as logging in to the portal.
