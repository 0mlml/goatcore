"""
Retroactive-notice renderer — the reference implementation of the general
onboarding-email formula (docs/design/onboarding-email-formula.md). Emails an
already-onboarded person about something new, in the fixed 4-part shape:

  1. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  (prior state, role-customized)
  2. RECAP            (what they already have, role-driven)
  3. WHAT'S NEW       (the reason block -- the ONLY campaign-specific input)
  4. WHY IT MATTERS   (short, role-aware line)

Initial onboarding and permission upgrades are the same formula with a different
prior-state + reason; this tool is the batch driver for the notice case.

DETERMINISTIC: identical (roster row, notice) -> identical bytes. No randomness,
no time-of-render values in the body.

Usage:
  render.py <roster.tsv> <out.json> <notice.json>
    roster.tsv  : name<TAB>email<TAB>groups-csv<TAB>whitelisted  (groups from
                  Kratos traits.groups; e.g. "PLATFORM-ADMIN,IAM-ADMIN" or "(none)")
    notice.json : the reason block -- see notice.relay-health.json for the shape.
  Emits [{name,email,role,deliverable,subject,body}, ...] as JSON.

PII (roster, rendered bodies) is caller-supplied and MUST NOT be committed.
Sending is out of scope here -- pipe the output to SES v2 (send_manifest pattern).
