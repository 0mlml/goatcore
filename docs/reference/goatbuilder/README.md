# goatbuilder reference

The complete reference for `goatbuilder` and the deployment processes around
it. These files are the source of the goatbuilder book, which
`docs/goatbuilder-book/compose.sh` builds and the goat-docs role serves at
`docs.<site>.<zone>/goatbuilder/`, and of the printed handout.

The [command reference](command-reference.md) is every verb's `--help`, walked
from the binary's live clap tree by `goatbuilder docs --markdown` and committed
here; a test regenerates it and refuses a diff, so it can never drift from what
the binary does. The book renders the same bytes. Figures are in `figures/`.
