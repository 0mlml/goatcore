# Post-partition convergence runbook

**Audience.** On-call operator at any goat site after a network partition (intra-site or inter-site) of >5 min duration involving the postgres-spock mgmt-plane. Also the destination for runbook links from `SpockSubscriptionNotReplicating`, `SpockSlotInactive`, `SpockSlotWALSenderLag`, `SpockACEDriftDetected`, and `SpockACEDriftWatchStale`.

**Goal.** Move from "partition healed at the network level" → "convergence verified, incident closed." Until every step below passes, **the site stays in incident state.** A green network does not mean a green database.

**Authority.** Implements [`docs/design/replication-consistency-observability.md` §5](../design/replication-consistency-observability.md). Canonical conflict-policy reference: [ADR 1010](../adr/1010-ory-on-spock-mindful-operation.md) D5/D7 + [`daily-state-reconciliation.md`](../design/daily-state-reconciliation.md) §6.

## 0. Pre-flight — what you should already have open

- Grafana → Spock-health dashboard
- Prometheus → alerts page
- An admin SSH session into the affected mgmt-host
- The pgEdge ace CLI **if** installed (Phase 3+; not present at v1) — otherwise the L2a check uses the drift-watch cron output

If you are paged with `SpockSlotInvalidated`, **stop reading this and go directly to** §A "Slot rebuild" below — convergence is impossible from an invalidated slot; the slot must be rebuilt first.

---

## 1. L1 caught up — replication has resumed and lag is bounded

```bash
# On any mgmt-host with psql access to local postgres-a
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d netbird -c \
  "SELECT subscription_name, status,
          COALESCE(replication_lag::text, '—') AS lag
   FROM spock.sub_show_status();"
```

**Pass criteria:**

- Every subscription `status` is `replicating` (not `init`, not `down`, not `unknown`).
- Every subscription's `replication_lag` is **< 5 s** sustained over **2 consecutive minutes**.
- The 2-minute window is a hard prereq — the `SpockSubscriptionLag` alert has a 2 m `for:` clause and can flap. Watch the dashboard line, not just the absence of alerts.

**Common holds:**

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `status = init` | Subscription is doing initial sync (full table copy) | Wait. Initial sync of the netbird DB at our scale takes single-digit minutes; if >30 min, escalate. |
| `status = down` | Apply worker crashed | `psql ... -c "SELECT spock.sub_enable('<sub>');"`. Check Postgres logs for the underlying error before retry. |
| `lag` keeps growing | Provider WAL sender is sending faster than network can drain | Check `SpockSlotWALSenderLag` panel — this is the alert that surfaces this case. |
| `lag` is 0 but `status` says `replicating` | If `pg_replication_slots.active = false` for the same slot, the subscription thinks it's healthy but no bytes are flowing. See §2. |

---

## 2. No invalidated slots, all slots active

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -c \
  "SELECT slot_name, slot_type, database, active,
          pg_size_pretty(
            pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), restart_lsn)
          ) AS retained_wal,
          wal_status
   FROM pg_replication_slots
   ORDER BY slot_name;"
```

**Pass criteria:**

- `wal_status` is `reserved` or `extended` for every slot (NOT `lost`).
- `active` is `t` for every slot belonging to a Spock subscription.
- `retained_wal` < `max_slot_wal_keep_size` (default 1 GiB).

**If `wal_status = lost` on any slot** → go to §A. The slot is invalidated; convergence cannot proceed without rebuild.

**If `active = false` but `wal_status` healthy** → the consumer disconnected without invalidating. Check:

```bash
psql ... -c "SELECT pid, application_name, state, sync_state, sent_lsn, flush_lsn
             FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```

If empty or missing the expected subscriber: the subscriber's WAL receiver isn't connected. On the *subscribing* node, run `psql ... -c "SELECT spock.sub_enable('<sub>');"` to retry. Network path issues: verify mesh IP reachability and TCP 5432 from subscriber to provider.

## 3. Conflicts triaged

Every conflict and every skipped change recorded during the partition window
must be human-reviewed. Revocations are not part of this review: the revocation
guard (ADR 1193) keeps them whichever write wins; step 3c checks it.

Spock 5 has no `spock.conflict_log`. Conflicts are in `spock.resolutions`
(`spock.save_resolutions = on`, set in the `postgres-spock` image) and changes
the apply worker could not apply are in `spock.exception_log`. Both are per
database: run each query in `netbird`, `kratos` and `hydra`, on every site. A
conflict is recorded only at the site that **kept** its local row; the site whose
row was overwritten records nothing, so read every site.

**3a. Conflicts resolved by last-writer-wins**

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d netbird -x -c \
  "SELECT * FROM spock.resolutions
   WHERE log_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '<partition duration> + 10 minutes'
   ORDER BY log_time DESC;"
```

For **each row**, decide:

1. **LWW winner correct** — the row that "won" via last-writer-wins is the operationally correct version. No action needed; mark the row reviewed.
2. **LWW winner wrong** — the row that lost is the correct one. Apply a compensating UPDATE on the winning side via the relevant service's admin API (NOT direct SQL — per ADR 1010 D4). Document the override in the incident log.
3. **Conflict reflects competing intent** — both sides intended different things; this is a mission-policy question, escalate to the policy owner.

**3b. Remote changes skipped on apply**

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d netbird -x -c \
  "SELECT * FROM spock.exception_log ORDER BY remote_commit_ts DESC LIMIT 50;"
```

An `UPDATE` with "did not find row to be updated" on a row this site deleted is
expected and correct: the delete stands. Any other row is a change that did not
land here, and the sites disagree on that row until it is re-applied through the
service's admin API.

**3c. Revocations held**

```bash
for db in netbird kratos; do
  psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -d "$db" -tAc "SELECT '$db sweep changed ' || goat_revocation_sweep() || ' rows';"
done
```

Expect `0` on every site. A non-zero count means a revoked row had come back
and the sweep has just corrected it; record which (`SELECT * FROM
goat_revocations ORDER BY at DESC LIMIT 20;`) in the incident log.

Do not declare convergence until 3a and 3b have zero un-reviewed rows newer than
the partition start and 3c returns 0 on every site.

For Ory tables (`kratos.identities`, `hydra_client`) — F-003 silent column-loss can occur on concurrent updates (LWW is *per-row*, not per-column). §4 catches divergence between sites; it cannot catch a value both sites agree on, which is why 3c exists for revocations.

---

## 4. L2a clean — manual ACE drift-watch run

**Standard path (drift-watch cron installed per Block 52A.3):**

```bash
sudo systemctl start spock-drift-watch.service
cat /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile/spock_ace_drift.prom \
  | grep -E '^spock_ace_drift_rows' \
  | awk '{ if ($NF != "0") print }'
```

**Pass criteria:** every `spock_ace_drift_rows` line ends in `0`. Any non-zero value indicates row-level divergence on that table-pair.

**Fallback path (drift-watch cron not yet installed):**

```bash
# For each watched table, run on each peer and diff
TABLES="accounts users setup_keys peers groups policies"
for db in netbird; do
  for tab in $TABLES; do
    echo "=== $db.$tab ==="
    for peer in postgres-a postgres-b; do
      psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p $([ "$peer" = "postgres-a" ] && echo 5432 || echo 5433) \
           -U postgres -d "$db" -A -t -c \
           "SELECT COUNT(*), md5(string_agg(md5(t::text), ',' ORDER BY t::text)) FROM $tab t;"
    done
  done
done
```

The two output lines for each table must match exactly. Mismatches → divergence.

**On detected drift:** the row-level identification is **L3 reconciler scope** (ADR 0823) and is not yet implemented. Until then:

- Log every drifting (table, peer-pair) tuple in the incident log.
- Compare canonical state via the relevant service's admin API where possible (Kratos → admin API GET on each identity; netbird-mgmt → API GET on each account/peer).
- Apply compensating writes through admin APIs only.

---

## 5. L2b clean — schema coherence

Until Block 52C ships the schema-drift cron, this is manual:

```bash
for peer_port in 5432 5433; do
  echo "=== port $peer_port ==="
  pg_dump -h 127.0.0.1 -p $peer_port -U postgres -s netbird | sha256sum
  pg_dump -h 127.0.0.1 -p $peer_port -U postgres -s kratos  | sha256sum
  pg_dump -h 127.0.0.1 -p $peer_port -U postgres -s hydra   | sha256sum
done
```

**Pass criteria:** SHA-256 hashes for the same DB across peers match exactly.

**On schema mismatch:** STOP. Do not proceed to §6. Schema drift means a DDL was applied to one peer and not the other, almost certainly a migration that didn't replicate. This is a CRITICAL incident — schema drift can cause silent application errors, data corruption on subsequent writes, and breaks replication invariants.

Resolution: identify the missing migration via `\dx` extension list compare + `\d <table>` per table, apply the missing DDL by hand (with operator pair-review), then re-run §5 until clean.

---

## 6. 30-minute observation window

**Only after §1–§5 pass:** start a 30-minute observation timer. During the window:

- No new alerts from `SpockSubscriptionLag`, `SpockSubscriptionNotReplicating`, `SpockSlotInactive`, `SpockSlotInvalidated`, `SpockSlotWALNearLimit`, `SpockSlotWALSenderLag`, `SpockConflictLogged`, `SpockACEDriftDetected`.
- Drift-watch cron emits a fresh successful-run timestamp at least once.
- Replication lag remains < 5 s on both directions.

If any of the above fires during the 30-min window, **the clock resets to step 1.** Convergence is not declared while alerts are flapping.

After 30 clean minutes: declare convergence in the incident log + close the page.

---

## A. Slot rebuild — the destructive path

This appendix is invoked when `wal_status = lost`. The subscriber can no longer replay from the slot; it must be rebuilt from a `pg_basebackup`. **This is destructive on the subscriber side** — its data is wiped and replaced from the provider. Confirm with a second operator before proceeding if site impact is non-trivial.

The mechanics are documented in [`goat-ha-dev-validation.md` §1.6](goat-ha-dev-validation.md#16-wal-slot-invalidation--pg_basebackup-rebuild). Summary:

```bash
# On the subscriber side (the one with wal_status=lost)
docker compose -f /opt/mgmt-host/docker-compose.yml stop postgres
sudo rm -rf /opt/docker-data/postgres/pgdata/*

# From a healthy provider
pg_basebackup -h <provider-host> -p <provider-port> -U replicator \
  -D /opt/docker-data/postgres/pgdata -X stream -P -R

# Restart subscriber, recreate Spock subscription
docker compose -f /opt/mgmt-host/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
# Spock node + subscription registration handled by the
# coordinated-upgrade Ansible play; refer to that play rather than
# typing SQL by hand for production sites.
```

After rebuild completes, return to step 1 and run the full convergence loop — a rebuild is itself a partition+heal in the data path.

---

## What this runbook does NOT do

- **Auto-remediation.** Every step requires operator decision + pair-review where the runbook calls for it. The mgmt-plane state is too sensitive for auto-merge before [ADR 0823](../adr/0823-daily-state-reconciliation.md) authoritative-mode lands with explicit per-table conflict policy.
- **Replace [`goat-ha-dev-validation.md`](goat-ha-dev-validation.md).** That doc owns the validation probes. This doc owns the production-incident response.
- **Cover relay, signal, or Zenoh consistency.** Those have their own surfaces. Mgmt-plane only here.
- **Backstop a missing pair operator.** The "pair-reviewed: no" entry in the template is an audit trail, not a green light. Single-operator convergence at 03:00 is acceptable; un-reviewed convergence is not.
