| Implementation note 2026-05-31 | The `Decision` §"Storage" line names a "1 year online + 6 years archive" retention split without naming the substrate for the *archive* tier, AND implicitly assumes COMPLIANCE-mode lock on the online tier. [`../design/audit-cold-storage-offload.md`](../design/audit-cold-storage-offload.md) refines both: the substrate is a three-tier shape (router rocksdb 7d / MinIO 30d **GOVERNANCE** online / cold-storage bucket COMPLIANCE-locked operator-triggered offload). The COMPLIANCE bar is preserved at the cold-storage tier (where evidence-grade preservation lives); the online tier moves to GOVERNANCE so the substrate can FIFO-evict oldest under quota pressure instead of failing new writes — the more common operational case. Layered defenses (least-privilege audit-subscriber S3 user, FIFO-eviction service audit-trail, write-rate anomaly alerts) cover the rare attacker case. The 1y/6y/AU-11 bar is preserved: production sites apply a scheduled (e.g., monthly) offload + a 7y COMPLIANCE retention on the cold-storage bucket. Trial fabrics use the same substrate shape with shorter retentions matched to their disk budget. The substrate-shape decision is the same fleet-wide; the retention *values* differ per-deployment. Production deployments without a cold-archive offload cadence can override the middle tier to COMPLIANCE to keep the original ADR 0811 posture (one tier doing both jobs). |

## TL;DR (for a layperson)

Audit logs are only useful if they can't be quietly modified.
We store audit records in MinIO with Object Lock enabled,
which makes objects immutable for a defined retention period.
We additionally maintain an integrity ledger — a hash chain
across records — so that any tampering after the fact would
break the chain. A daily CI job verifies the chain.

## Diagram



Source: [`diagrams/0811-audit-log-integrity.mmd`](diagrams/0811-audit-log-integrity.mmd).

## Context

Audit logs that can be modified are evidence-grade only as
far as the modifying authority is trusted. For
contested-environment use cases, audit-record immutability is
critical.

Three layers of integrity:

1. Storage immutability (Object Lock).
2. Hash-chain integrity (ledger).
3. Daily verification (CI).

Each catches different tamper modes.

## Decision

Audit-log integrity tier:

- **Storage**: per-site MinIO with Object Lock in compliance
  mode. Retention: 1 year online + 6 years archive.
- **Cross-mounted peer-mgmt-host storage**: Router-A's MinIO
  cross-mounts to Router-B and vice versa, so a single-host
  loss doesn't lose audit.
- **Integrity ledger**: hash-chain of audit records;
  per-record hash includes prior-record hash; chain head is
  itself periodically signed.
- **Daily tamper-detection CI**: walks the ledger, verifies
  every record, alerts on chain break.
- **Sources** (matching `egress-proxy.md` §5.6 in-scope event
  classes):
  - Egress decisions — nftables, Squid, dante (per [`0806`](0806-egress-proxy-cascade.md)).
  - Auth + sudo on mgmt-host — auditd, journald (per [`0800`](0800-open-source-edr.md), [`0808`](0808-pam.md)).
  - Config changes to egress / ACL policy — git commit + Ansible
    deploy + policy-engine events (per [`0805`](0805-policy-engine-active-passive.md)).
  - Break-glass exceptions — allowlist `break_glass:` blocks.
  - Privilege escalation attempts — auditd.
  - Peer enrollment / de-enrollment — NetBird management API +
    admit-audit sidecar metrics ([`0816`](0816-admit-audit-sidecar.md)
    — note: admit-audit is a *signal generator*, not a tamper-proof
    record source; its alerts feed Alertmanager, while the canonical
    enrollment audit comes from the management API itself).
  - Audit-logger interceptor on the data fabric ([`0508`](0508-audit-logger-interceptor.md)).

  **Out of scope (v1)** per the design doc: application-level logs
  (hosted applications, Zenoh sample payloads), Traefik
  access logs, routine Prometheus scrapes.

Section §5.6 of
[`../design/egress-proxy.md`](../design/egress-proxy.md) is
the design source.

## Alternatives considered

- **Filesystem-only audit logs.** No tamper resistance.
  Rejected.
- **Cloud-only audit storage.** Loses sovereignty / Island
  Mode. Rejected.
- **Hash-chain only, no Object Lock.** Object Lock prevents
  silent overwrites; complementary to hash-chain.

## Consequences

**Positive.** Three-layer integrity. Tamper-resistant audit.
Cross-mounted across A/B routers. Daily verification gives
freshness guarantee.

**Negative.** Storage cost (1 year online + 6 years archive).
Acceptable for the integrity property.

## Assessor view (SCA-R)

Audit-log integrity serves AU-9 (protection of audit
information), AU-10 (non-repudiation — paired with event
signatures from [`0511`](0511-publisher-trust-model.md)),
AU-11 (audit record retention — 1y online + 6y archive),
and SI-7 (integrity).

The comparative-posture artifact identifies "audit retention
integrity" as a dimension where goat is ahead.

## Trigger conditions for revisit

- Storage volume becomes unmanageable. Shorten online
  retention (push to archive faster); do not lose the
  retention bar.
- A specific authorization mandates a different audit
  storage scheme. Add a federation adapter; preserve the
  per-site sovereign tier.
